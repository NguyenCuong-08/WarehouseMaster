                          <p>It is normal and expected for your final career matches to not always completely align with your professional aspirations. As CareerHunter uses your interest, personality, motivator and aptitude scores, we are looking at your overall compatibility on a psychometric level so it’s normal to expect some surprises.</p>
    <p>For example, let’s say you want to become a teacher. This profession generally requires an extrovert personality, but if you prefer working independently, you will receive higher career matches that are more suitable to your introvert personality, while also taking into consideration your other results.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <p>That being said, if you feel many of your career matches don’t make any sense, reach out to us and we’ll investigate.</p>
